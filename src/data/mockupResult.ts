  title: 'Fitbit Stole My Watch (The Real Burn🔥)',
  description:
    'I sent my Fitbit Ionic watch in because Fitbit had a recall due to their product burning people. Yes. You heard right. They burned people and had to recall 1.7 million watches.\\n\\nAfter 6 months of waiting and calling their refund center I had been told a number of things.  A wrong serial number of “00000” was placed on it by Fitbit. My complaint would be “escalated” and your refund will be coming shortly. I have now finally been told I sent a different device. No other explanation. Like I don’t know what watch I had. They didn’t even have the courtesy to make up a device name. I mean that could be anything from a Apple Watch to a toaster. \\n\\nAnyway, I thought somebody in this forum should know that if your watch doesn’t burn your arm. Then also be worried of the company just taking it from you and pretending they didn’t. Just another kind of Burn🔥\\n\\nAnybody with a similar story? \\n\\nI will continue this just fight against corporate greed. 💪',
